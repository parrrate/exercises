# Topics

Rows are ordered based on estimated difficulty.

| lifetimes\[-adjacent\] | `trait`s           | `struct`s     |
|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| [explicit lifetimes]   | [`Fn`?]            | [`Duration`]  |
| [extracting lifetimes] | [exclusive traits] | [All Errors?] |
| [composition]          | [merging traits]   | [`RcChars`]   |
|                        |                    | [`AnyStr`]    |

p.s. most of the exercises are actually about `trait`s, this categorisation isn't strict.
