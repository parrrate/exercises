# Exercises

Random Rust exercises. Mostly typesystem-oriented.

**Warning if you're viewing this not on github.io: this is a live-edited website, errors and accidental spoilers are to be expected.**

# Solutions

Presently, solutions are often provided in a non-human-readable (compacted+misformatted) form as hidden code.
Those are intended for testing that the exercise is even possible to solve.
```rust
# /*
fn fix_me() {  // Greyed out because the solution changes this line.
# */
# fn fixed_name() {
}

fn do_not_change_this() {
    fixed_name()
}
```
Some exercises may not have the replaced parts greyed out:
```rust
# mod __ {
fn fix_me() {
}
# }
# fn fixed_name() {
# }

fn do_not_change_this() {
    fixed_name()
}
```
