# Exercises

Random Rust exercises.

**Warning: this is a live-edited website, errors and accidental spoilers are to be expected.**

# Solutions

Currently solutions are mostly provided in a non-human-readable form in the page source.
Those are mostly intended for testing that the exercise is even possible to solve.
```rust
# /*
fn fix_me() {  // Greyed out because the solution changes this line.
# */
# fn fixed_name() {
}

fn do_not_change_this() {
    fixed_name()
}
```
Some exercises may not include have the replaced parts greyed out:
```rust
# mod __ {
fn fix_me() {
}
# }
# fn fixed_name() {
# }

fn do_not_change_this() {
    fixed_name()
}
```
